# SUMMARY FOR 2023

I've been through a lot this year. From the beginning of the second semester of the second year to the end of the first semester of the third year, I experienced a lot of things during this period.

From the beginning of 2023, made some exchange friends, and we all went to a party together. I also invited those friends to have dinner together during the Chinese New Year evening. Wonderful networking, until now, we still chat online ðŸ¤£.

After summer came in, Participated in the International WIE internship, crossed the country, and worked in Paris, not only to experience the working culture and environment in Europe but also to expand my eyes, my network, and my worldwide view.

Also, during the weekend time in Europe, I went to some countries, SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª, and some cities in France, experienced the slow pace of life and environment in Europe. I remember an old man from Switzerland chatting with me for half an hour in front of the lake. He heard that I was from China. He also recalled his previous trips to China and discussed his favorite Chinese novels with me.

Joined a hackathon with my friends across the different timelines and the time in different regions, but we still worked together and got the Merit AwardðŸ¥‡. (Hey, we never stop at this award, and we are also looking forward to it. This is a small award, but it is bigger in our hearts! GO FOR IT ðŸš€)

Back to school, a lot of fun happened with our teams. I will never forget the group mates who fought with me. We worked together and laughed together. Always be the best memory that I will keep at the university.

Also, I got a full-time 6-month internship! Although it is a start-up company, I believe in them. By the way, this will happen next year, I hope I can do better coding in that time, hahahahaha.

End in here, but the experiences here are definitely not at all, keep in mind, and those are the best memories for me in this year.
